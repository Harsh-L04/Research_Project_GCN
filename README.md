# 📘 GCN_Project: Graph Convolutional Networks on Citation Datasets

This repository explores the use of **Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)** for **node classification** tasks on citation networks such as **Cora** and **Citeseer**.

Each dataset is organized in its own folder with dedicated code, outputs, and documentation. The goal is to compare performance, understand GCN behavior, and visualize embeddings on real-world graphs.

### ✅ Final Touch Checklist

Make sure your repo contains:
- `cora/README.md`
- `citeseer/README.md`
- `report/report.pdf`
- `environment.yml` (optional but helpful)
- `.gitignore` (for Python projects, include `__pycache__/`, `.ipynb_checkpoints/`, etc.)

Let me know if you’d like me to help write the `README.md` for the `cora/` or `citeseer/` folders too!
